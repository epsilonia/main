Making it a social experience


* The video content (not necessarily in this order):
	Two or three examples, an intuitive definition, or a real-world problem
	Why is it important? What problem does it solve?
	The formal definition 
	A visual representation 
	A plain language formulation
	Something beautiful about it
	Something to think about

Create a plan for the content of the video
Create a detailed plan for the video: a description of what each scene will contain
Create mockups (slides with no animation and no details)
Use mockups to:
	* Create the script 
	* Enrich the slides with handwritten text
For each mathematical concept: 
	* Make sure it is presented using the three learning channels
	* Make sure an example is given
	* Make sure the mathematical definition/result is explicited
Improve the quality of the text using ChatGPT
Mathematical rigorousness of the text and the slides and possible errors
Check the consistency of the text with the slides
What animations can be added to the slides to fill in the blanks and make them more attractive?
Compatibility with American notations: points & commas, intervals, etc.

Record the script
Listen to the recorded audio while reading the script to make sure it's complete
